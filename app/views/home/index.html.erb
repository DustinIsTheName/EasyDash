    <h6 class="accordion-trigger" data-group="faqs" data-accordion="0">Are description images handled differently on EasyDash?</h6>
    <div class="card accordion-target" data-group="faqs" data-accordion="0" style="display:none;">
      <p>Short answer, yes. Long answer is Shopify usually stores description images in the Files section (within the Settings area) but they do not allow developers to store images in the Files section via their API. Since this is the case, we have to store the description images within the Assets section of a theme. We chose to create a new theme called “EasyDash Images” to store the description images , instead of simply storing them within the Assets of the live theme, because of potential issues in the future if you chose to change themes, upgrade your theme, etc. Having a separate theme for description images allows our app to store the new description images within one single theme so you don’t have to worry about where all of your images are stored since downloading EasyDash.</p>

      <p>We’ll continue to keep a close eye on Shopify’s improvements to their API and will change the description images to work the same way they do on the Shopify backend when/if they give developers the ability to do so.</p>

      <p class="no_margin">If you chose to uninstall EasyDash, we provide you via email with a list of all of the images that have been added since downloading our app for your reference.</p>

      <p class="no_margin">Future publish dates are not able to be set on EasyDash. You will have to continue to set those in Shopify's admin dashboard.</p>
